# Safe Travels 

## Inspiration
We wanted to create a user-friendly app utilizing Machine Learning/AI

## What it does
It tracks the eye movement and makes a noise if you are blinking for too long and can reach out for an emergency if needed. Also, it has a built-in calculator function for Blood Alcohol Content.

## How I built it
We built this using Android Studio utilizing Java, along with facial recognition, google cloud, Machine Learning/AI, etc.

## Challenges I ran into
Trying to integrate the emergency call and the BAC calculator.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Being able to integrate Machine Learning/AI in our application and being able to figure out about Blood Alcohol Content

## What I learned
We learn how to train the ML models.

## What's next for Safe Travels
We want to add more features in the future and make it more user-friendly which enables the traveler have more safety when traveling. In the future, we plan to integrate automatic hazard lights and have the car come to a complete stop if it detects a certain safety issue in the car.
